 I have dived deeper into the business dataset to uncover valuable insights and turned it into actionable hypotheses. 

 ⊛ In this scenario, the casual & member riders tend to use the classic bike than any other bikes. There are a very few members that wants to take use docked bike.  

 ⊛ The bikes are mostly used on weekends than during the weekdays 

 ⊛ I found that the month July has the highest duration for the bikes being used and February has the lowest duration. 

 ⊛ I found that more people are using the bike in the evening, with the least amount of people using the bike at night. 

 ⊛ I could see an increasing trend starting at 5am till 5pm where people are using the bikes the most amount of time.
