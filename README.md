 _  _  _ Insights and Findings _  _  _ 
 
 I have dived deeper into the business dataset to uncover valuable insights and turned it into actionable hypotheses. 

 ⊛ In this scenario, the casual & member riders tend to use the classic bike than any other bikes. There are a very few members that wants to take use docked bike.  

 ⊛ The bikes are mostly used on weekends than during the weekdays 

 ⊛ I found that the month July has the highest duration for the bikes being used and February has the lowest duration. 

 ⊛ I found that more people are using the bike in the evening, with the least amount of people using the bike at night. 

 ⊛ I could see an increasing trend starting at 5am till 5pm where people are using the bikes the most amount of time.

Team goal: Design marketing strategies aimed at converting casual riders into annual members. In order to be able to acomplish the goal, there are 3 questions that need to be answered:

How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?
Why would casual riders buy Cyclistic annual memberships?
How can Cyclistic use digital media to influence casual riders to become members?
I was assigned with the first question: How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?

In order to answer all business questions, I will use the six steps of the data analysis process: Ask, Prepare, Process, Analyize, Share, Act.

Use cases: 

It can be inferred that casual riders are more likely to use their bikes for longer periods of time than the member riders- may be member riders use the bike for short rides and commuting to work and back home, whereas the casual riders use it for sightseeing around and other exercising. Casual riders are more likely to use rides on weekends and member riders on weekdays. Based on this finding, it’s worth considering to offer new types of membership focused on weekend rides and family membership (families tend to spend their weekends together) to casual riders so that we can convert them into member riders.
